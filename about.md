Hey, my name is John. I received my BSc in Physics from Trent University in 2021. During my undergrad I spent two summers as an undergraduate researcher, focusing on polaron dynamics in WO3-based thin film devices and the morphology-dependent resonances of microwave-irradiated aqueous spheroids. Work from the latter of these projects resulted in my [first publication](https://doi.org/10.1063/5.0122773). I am currently pursuing a MSc in Materials Science at Trent University as well. My research is focused on using machine learning for non-resonant background removal in Coherent Anti-Stokes Raman Scattering (CARS) microscopy. This project requires a wide range of skills—such as programming, instrumentation, and photonics—which are helping me grow into a well-rounded and competent experimentalist.

Apart from my academic interests, I have many hobbies and love to try new things. My current hobbies include: playing guitar, recording music, computer graphics programming/game development, and cybersecurity.
