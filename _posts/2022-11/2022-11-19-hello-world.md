So... I decided to finally make a personal blog. I am aiming for weekly posts that summarize my most important work/thoughts throughout the week. I would like these posts to have an informal tone and be fairly quick and messy. A certain optimism is required to believe that I will stick with this schedule, but I would like to see it happen since it would surely improve my writing and help keep me grounded. Ultimately, my goal with these posts is that they will help someone out there some day similarly to how seemingly random blog posts I've found from a quick Google search have helped me answer many questions throughout the years.
